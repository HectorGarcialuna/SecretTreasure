  <h1>Secrets</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Begin your quest in the historic city of London, UK. Locate the iconic British Museum. Inside, you will find an artifact known as the Rosetta Stone. The secret hieroglyphs on the stone hold the first clue to the Treasure Planet map.</li>
    <li>Next, travel to the Great Pyramids of Egypt. Enter the Pyramid of Khufu, and seek the inner chamber. There, beneath the sarcophagus, a hidden inscription reveals the second part of the map.</li>
    <li>Your journey continues to the ancient city of Athens, Greece. Climb to the top of the Acropolis and align your view with the Parthenon's columns at sunrise. The shadow cast reveals the third portion of the map.</li>
    <li>From there, venture to the beautiful city of Venice, Italy. Find the Bridge of Sighs during a full moon. The reflection in the water uncovers another piece of the map.</li>
    <li>Now, head to Machu Picchu in Peru. Navigate the intricate Incan ruins until you reach the Temple of the Sun. The pattern of light at sunset through the temple's window discloses another map segment.</li>
    <li>Then, journey to the Great Wall of China. Walk the wall until you reach the highest watchtower. Carved into the ancient stones, the next part of the map awaits.</li>
    <li>Finally, venture to the North Pole during the Northern Lights. The constellation formed in the sky reveals the last piece of the Treasure Planet map. With all pieces combined, the path to unimaginable riches is now in your hands.</li>
</ul>
